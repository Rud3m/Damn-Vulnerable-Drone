## What is the Damn Vulnerable Drone?

The Damn Vulnerable Drone is a virtually simulated environment designed for offensive security professionals to safely learn and practice drone hacking techniques. It simulates real-world [ArduPilot](https://ardupilot.org/) & [MAVLink](https://mavlink.io/en/) drone architectures and vulnerabilities, offering a hands-on experience in exploiting drone systems. 

## Why was it built?

The Damn Vulnerable Drone aims to enhance offensive security skills within a controlled environment, making it an invaluable tool for intermediate-level security professionals, pentesters, and hacking enthusiasts.

Similar to how pilots utilize flight simulators for training, we can use the Damn Vulnerable Drone simulator to gain in-depth knowledge of real-world drone systems, understand their vulnerabilities, and learn effective methods to exploit them.

The Damn Vulnerable Drone platform is open-source and available at no cost and was specifically designed to address the substantial expenses often linked with drone hardware, hacking tools, and maintenance. Its cost-free nature allows users to immerse themselves in drone hacking without financial concerns. This accessibility makes the Damn Vulnerable Drone a crucial resource for those in the fields of information security and penetration testing, promoting the development of offensive cybersecurity skills in a safe environment.

## How does it work?

The Damn Vulnerable Drone platform operates on the principle of [Software-in-the-Loop (SITL)](https://ardupilot.org/dev/docs/sitl-simulator-software-in-the-loop.html), a simulation technique that allows users to run drone software as if it were executing on an actual drone, thereby replicating authentic drone behaviors and responses.

ArduPilot's SITL allows for the execution of the drone's firmware within a virtual environment, mimicking the behavior of a real drone without the need for physical hardware. This simulation is further enhanced with Gazebo, a dynamic 3D robotics simulator, which provides a realistic environment and physics engine for the drone to interact with. Together, ArduPilot's SITL and Gazebo lay the foundation for a sophisticated and authentic drone simulation experience.

While the current Damn Vulnerable Drone setup doesn't mirror every drone architecture or configuration, the integrated tactics, techniques and scenarios are broadly applicable across various drone systems, models and communication protocols.

## Getting Docker (Key Dependency)

The following instructions are meant to be executed on the latest version of [Kali Linux](https://www.kali.org/).

**Step 1.** Add the docker apt source

`printf '%s\n' "deb https://download.docker.com/linux/debian bullseye stable" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker-ce.list`

**Step 2.** Import the GPG Key

`curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/debian/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/docker-ce-archive-keyring.gpg`

**Step 3.** Update the apt repository

`sudo apt update -y`

**Step 4.** Install Docker and Docker Compose

`sudo apt install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io -y`

**Step 5.** Start the Docker Service

`sudo systemctl enable docker --now`

**Step 6.** Add docker permissions to user

`sudo usermod -aG docker $USER`

## Clone the repository

`git clone https://github.com/nicholasaleks/Damn-Vulnerable-Drone.git && cd Damn-Vulnerable-Drone`

## Build / Pull Docker Images

`docker compose build`

If you’d rather download the ready-made images (which tends to be faster than local builds), run the following command to pull all Damn Vulnerable Drone images from Docker Hub:

`docker compose pull`

or pulling individual Damn Vulnerable Drone images using the following:

```
docker pull n1ckaleks/damn-vulnerable-drone-flight-controller:latest
docker pull n1ckaleks/damn-vulnerable-drone-simulator:latest
docker pull n1ckaleks/damn-vulnerable-drone-companion-computer:latest
docker pull n1ckaleks/damn-vulnerable-drone-ground-control-station:latest
```

## Operating Damn Vulnerable Drone

Damn Vulnerable Drone includes three useful bash scripts which will help you manage the state of your simulator.

#### Starting Damn Vulnerable Drone

The start script is used to start Damn Vulnerable Drone simulator. This script will automatically create a `dvd.log` log file in the project directory, which you can use to view the simulator logs. 

> [!TIP]  
> If you have not already built or pulled Damn Vulnerable Drone images the `start.sh` script will automatically pull and build them for you.

```
sudo ./start.sh -h

Usage: sudo ./start.sh [OPTION]
Start the Damn Vulnerable Drone simulator.

Options:
  --wifi  [wep|wpa2]    Start the simulation with a virtual drone Wi-Fi network.
  --no-wifi   Start the simulation with instant access to the drone network (default).
  -h, --help  Display this help and exit.

Example:
  sudo ./start.sh --wifi wpa2     # Starts with virtual Wi-Fi in WPA2 mode
  sudo ./start.sh --no-wifi   # Starts without virtual Wi-Fi
```

#### Stop

The stop script is used to perform a full cleanup of the Damn Vulnerable Drone simulator and all of its virtual interface artifacts. Stop logs are also appended to the `dvd.log` log file.

`sudo ./stop.sh`

#### Status

If you ever want to check the status of your simulator you can run the status script as shown below.

`sudo ./status.sh`

### Wi-Fi Mode 

"Wi-Fi Mode" (`--wifi`) allows for the most realistic virtual drone hacking simulation. It deploys a virtually simulated wireless network that you can interact with. This virtual wifi network acts as the data-link connection between the Ground Station and Drone Companion Computer, allowing for interesting scenarios from your attacker machine. When you deploy the Damn Vulnerable Drone using Wi-Fi Mode you will have access to the "Drone_Wifi" SSID and 192.168.13.0/24 network. There are two wifi modes supported WEP and WPA2.

> [!WARNING]  
> The 10.13.0.0/24 network is used to run the simulator infrastructure, should you attack this network, especially the simulator container on `10.13.0.5` this could cause your instance of Damn Vulnerable Drone to crash, warranting a potentially lengthy rebuild. 

### Non-Wi-Fi Mode

"Non-Wi-Fi Mode" (`--no-wifi`) essentially only runs the Damn Vulnerable Drone docker containers.
Unlike "Wi-Fi Mode" you are not limited to only running "Non-Wi-Fi Mode" within a Kali Linux VM. You'll be able to practice attacking the Damn Vulnerable Drone using just the stood up containers via `docker compose up --build`

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Not, "Non-Wi-Fi Mode" does not support wifi simulations and you will need to assume that you have an established initial access foothold on the drone data-link connection (via the 10.13.0.0/24 network)

## Architecture

The Damn Vulnerable Drone simulation and core drone architectural components are integrated within Docker containers, providing a stable, isolated environment for each component of the drone system. Docker facilitates easy setup, consistent performance across different systems, and simplifies the process of simulating complex drone architectures and scenarios.

Below is a high-level overview of the Damn Vulnerable Drone architecture:

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/nicholasaleks/Damn-Vulnerable-Drone/blob/master/simulator/mgmt/static/images/Damn-Vulnerable-Drone-Architecture.png?raw=true" alt="Damn Vulnerable Drone Architecture"/>
</p>

| Component           | Description                                                                                                                                                              | Docker IP | Wireless IP    |
|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|----------------|
| Flight Controller   | This is the brain of the drone, running the ArduPilot firmware to simulate a drone's flight controls. It interacts with the Gazebo simulator through a Gazebo driver, allowing it to process virtual sensor data and respond as if it were flying in the real world.                                                                                                        | 10.13.0.2 | -              |
| Companion Computer  | The Companion Computer (attached to the drone) handles higher-level processing tasks that are too complex for the flight controller. It manages wireless networking, telemetry logs, facilitates camera streaming for surveillance or reconnaissance, and interfaces with guidance systems for autonomous operations.                            | 10.13.0.3 | 192.168.13.1   |
| Ground Control Station | This component acts as the remote pilot's interface, providing mission planning capabilities, flight mapping, video streaming, and joystick control inputs. It communicates with the flight controller and companion computer over a simulated wireless MAVLink connection.                                                            | 10.13.0.4 | 192.168.13.14   |
| Simulator            | Gazebo provides a richly detailed 3D world where the physics of drone flight are accurately modeled. This allows for realistic simulations of how the drone would react to control inputs and environmental factors. It’s here that the rotors spin, and the virtual drone takes to the skies, all under the watchful control of the Simulator Management Web Console. Warning: Try not to target the simulator directly as this may break the Damn Vulnerable Drone | 10.13.0.5 | -              |


## Flight States

The Damn Vulnerable Drone has a range of flight states. Each flight state can be trigger by clicking on their buttons in the UI (http://localhost:8000). The ability to simulate these various flight states allows users to test and exploit different aspects of the drones operations. By clicking these states, you are essentially triggering the GCS to issue commands to the drone.

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/nicholasaleks/Damn-Vulnerable-Drone/blob/master/simulator/mgmt/static/images/flight-states.png?raw=true" alt="Damn Vulnerable Drone Flight States"/>
</p>

**1. Initial Boot:**
This simulates the drone's startup sequence, where all systems are initialized. Clicking this will simulate you "pressing" the power on button on the drone flight controller, allowing for the companion computer to establish a connection to it. This phase is critical for security/safety checks, calibration and ensuring communication protocols are setup before flight.

**2. Arm & Takeoff**
The phase where the drone transitions from a stationary state to airborne, testing the responsiveness of flight controls and the integrity of take-off protocols. Note: This may take some time to complete as the drone requires GPS & EKF3 to be ready)

**3. Autopilot Flight**
Represents the drone's ability to navigate autonomously based on predefined waypoints or dynamic commands, a vital state for exploring vulnerabilities in navigation and control systems.

**4. Emergency / Return-To-Land**
Simulates the drone's emergency protocols, automatically returning to a home location upon triggering fail-safes or loss of control signals, which can be a target for exploitation in hacking scenarios.

**5. Post-Flight Data Processing**
This state involves the handling of all data collected during the flight, including telemetry and logs, making it an important phase for understanding data exfiltration and integrity attacks.
