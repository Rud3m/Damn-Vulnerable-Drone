                        <p>Flight simulators have been used for decades in the aviation industry to train pilots on how to use and get familiar with complex aircraft systems. Recent advances in open-source flight controllers, ground control software and simulators have extended this capability to the world of autonomous drones and UAVs (unmanned aerial vehicles).</p>
                        <p>Similar to how pilots utilize flight simulators for training, we can use the Damn Vulnerable Drone simulator to gain in-depth knowledge of real-world drone systems, understand their vulnerabilities, and learn effective methods to exploit them.</p>
                        <p>The Damn Vulnerable Drone platform is <a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/nicholasaleks/Damn-Vulnerable-Drone">open-source</a> and available at no cost and was specifically designed to address the substantial expenses often linked with drone hardware, hacking tools, and maintenance. Its cost-free nature allows users to immerse themselves in drone hacking without financial concerns. This accessibility makes Damn Vulnerable Drone a crucial resource for those in the fields of information security and penetration testing, promoting the development of offensive cybersecurity skills in a safe and ethical environment.</p>

                        </div>
                        <p>The Damn Vulnerable Drone platform operates on the principle of <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://ardupilot.org/dev/docs/sitl-simulator-software-in-the-loop.html">Software-in-the-Loop (SITL)</a>, a simulation technique that allows users to run drone software as if it were executing on an actual drone, thereby replicating authentic drone behaviors and responses.</p>
                        <img src="/static/images/a43dbcd7-10b0-4f7a-b920-5925bac59642.gif" class="img-fluid rounded-3 mb-4" alt="Damn Vulnerable Drone Simulator Screenshot" />
                        <p>ArduPilot's SITL allows for the execution of the drone's firmware within a virtual environment, mimicking the behavior of a real drone without the need for physical hardware. This simulation is further enhanced with <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://gazebosim.org/home">Gazebo</a>, a dynamic 3D robotics simulator, which provides a realistic environment and physics engine for the drone to interact with. Together, ArduPilot's SITL and Gazebo lay the foundation for a sophisticated and authentic drone simulation experience.</p>
                        <p>While the current Damn Vulnerable Drone setup doesn't mirror every drone architecture or configuration, the integrated tactics, techniques and scenarios are broadly applicable across various drone systems, models and communication protocols.</p>

                        <p>Follow these steps to get the most out of DVD:</p>

                        <h4>Step 1: Read the Basic Operations Guide</h4>
                        <p>Delve into the <a class="link" href="/guide/basic-operations">Basic Operations</a> guide. This document will help you navigating the environment, as well as the tool you'll use to initially interact with the drone by engaging it's flight states. (<i>Within the simulator, we assume flight states are triggered by the ground control station "operator", and not you, the drone hacker</i>)</p>
                        
                        <h4>Step 2: Review the System Architecture </h4>
                        <p>Get a better idea of the Damn Vulnerable Drone <a class="link" href="/guide/system-architecture">System Architecture</a>. This will outline the core components used in a typicaly drone-stack, including flight controlls, ground control stations, and companion computers. This part will also help steer you away from accidently attacking the simulator infrastructure (preventing you from breaking DVD)</p>
                        
                        <h4>Step 3: Review documentation on MAVLink & Ardupilot</h4>
                        <p>After getting familiar with the Simulator, you'll want to read about <a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://mavlink.io/en/">MAVLink</a> and <a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://ardupilot.org/ardupilot/">Ardupilot</a>. This will ensure some you will have a good foundational understanding with some of the concepts introduced in the attack scenarios.</p>
                    
                        <h4>Step 4: Start the Attack Scenarios</h4>
                        <p>Next, actively engage with the <a class="link" href="/attacks">Attack Scenarios</a> presented by DVD. Start with reconnaissance to understand the simulated environment you're working in, then methodically progress through the scenarios from wireless attacks to data exfiltration. For users who have set up DVD with virtual wifi, you can explore the Wireless Network Attack scenarios to deepen your understanding of network vulnerabilities. If you didn't install the virtual wifi component, it's assumed you have network access, and you can skip directly to focusing on other vulnerabilities within the drone's network.</p>
